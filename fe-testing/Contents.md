## Introduction
These notes are part of a four hour course on frontend testing which is divided into two hours of theory and two hours of practice. 
This is just enough time for an introduction to frontend testing and the first of many steps that will hopefully follow.

### Goal
The goal of this course is to show at least one way of testing frontend code, give an overview of available testing tools and frameworks and to
