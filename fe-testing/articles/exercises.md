# Exercises
## Unit Testing
1. Setup the testing framework of your choice and practice writing unit tests.
You can practice and learn JavaScript at the same time by testing the Array object like in this [example](https://github.com/tjunghans/learning-javascript/blob/master/tests/Array.test.js)
2. Read Chapter 11. The Observer Pattern in http://tddjs.com. Implement test Observer Pattern and write the unit tests as described. Use Mocha, Jasmine or QUnit to write the tests. [Here is my version with Mocha](https://github.com/tjunghans/lectures/tree/master/fe-testing/ex01-the-oberserver-pattern)
3. Read Chapter 12. Abstracting Differences: Ajax in http://tddjs.com and implement the tests. The first part of the tests written with Node are [here](https://github.com/tjunghans/lectures/tree/master/fe-testing/ex02-abstracting-browser-differences-ajax).

## Component Testing
1. Download or checkout the project on https://github.com/tjunghans/learning-webdriverjs and get it to run on your machine.
2. Write your own component unit tests using the testing framework of your choice.

## Automation
Study [Substack's post on automation with Makefile and NPM run](http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run) and write your own automation scripts.

## Spying and Stubbing with Sinon
[Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) is a standalone library for writing test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript.

1. Study **Spies** and **Stubs**. Stubs and spies are almost the same, except that stubs deactivate the original functionality of the stubbed method. You can ignore mocks for now.
2. Study **Fake time** and **Testing Ajax**.
