# Introduction
The complexity of the frontent - mainly javascript - has increased dramatically over the past few years. A lot of business logic has shifted from backend to frontend thanks to better browsers, more advanced JavaScript and the popularity of AJAX. With the increase in amount of JavaScript in the frontend and the complexity that comes with it, the demand for tests has climbed as well.

## Motivation for writing tests
Writing tests provides confidence, stability and proof that your code works. Having tests gives you flexibility in allowing you to refactor without stress.Having good test coverage also helps finding and fixing bugs.

## Goal of this course
The goal of this course includes
- an intruction to tdd
- tipps on writing testable JavaScript
- an overview of testing levels
- an overview of testing tools (assertion libraries and test runners)
- examples with a few of these tools
- giving you a head start in writing
	+ unit tests,
	+ component tests and
	+ integration tests
- Test stubs and spies
- Automation techniques

## Reading material
This course makes heavy use of theory and examples from [Test-Driven JavaScript Development by Christian Johansen](http://tddjs.com/), a book I can highly recommend. Christian Johansen is also the creator of [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/), a JavaScript library for creating mocks, stubs and spies.

There are further references to articles and books throughout the course and also on the [Reference page](./references.md).
