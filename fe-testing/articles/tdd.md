# Test Driven Development (TDD)
Writing tests first is a big aid in the design of production code. One only implements what is needed and is forced to think about implementation details before writing code. Tests will show you cases you may not think of at first and eliminate the chance of a future bug.

## TDD Cycle
In the book [Test-Driven Development by Example](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321146530/) author Kent Beck explains the **tdd cycle** with the following steps:

>1. Quickly add a test.
>2. Run all tests and see the new one fail.
>3. Make a little change.
>4. Run all tests and see them all succeed.
>5. Refactor to remove duplication.
