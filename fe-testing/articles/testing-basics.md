# Testing Basics
This article covers the basics very quickly. Most of it is derived from [Christian Johansen's excellent book, Test-Driven JavaScript Development](http://tddjs.com) and summarized.

Following now are some terms that you should become familiar with when testing.

## The Unit Test
- a piece of code that tests a piece of production code
- should be easy and fast to run (otherwise developers won't run them)
- should test software components in isolation
- no test should depend on another test
- dependencies need sometimes be mocked or stubbed
- should be runnable at any time

## Assertions


## Red and Green
