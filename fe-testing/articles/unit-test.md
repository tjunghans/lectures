# Unit-Testing
Unit-tests are the most atomic, cheapest and fastest running tests. They should be fast running. If a unit-test doesn't complete within milliseconds then the test or the code being tested needs to be questioned. Another reason for slow performance may be the testing framework (Qunit, Jasmine, Mocha, etc)., but this will only be visible with a very high number of tests.
