# Automation
[GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) seem to be automation tools for the frontend developer of today. Developers using NodeJS may or may not know that there is a simpler and more direkt way of automating tasks using [npm run](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-run-script.html).

There is an excellent article on [task automation with npm run](http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run) and making use of `bash` and [make (Makefile)](http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/).
